This project presents a deepfake detection system that leverages Swin Transformer for extracting spatial features and 3D CNN for capturing temporal dynamics from videos. By combining both spatial and temporal information, the model achieves high accuracy in detecting manipulated video content.

**Features**

Spatial Feature Extraction using Swin Transformer
Temporal Feature Learning using 3D Convolutional Neural Network
Feature Fusion for combining spatial and temporal representations
Achieves 88% accuracy on FaceForensics++ dataset
Integrated with React.js frontend and Flask backend for real-time prediction
Evaluated on Celeb-DF(v2) for cross-dataset generalization
